### More Info

* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
