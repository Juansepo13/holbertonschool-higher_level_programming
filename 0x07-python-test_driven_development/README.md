## This is a README.md for the repository - 0x07. Python - Test-driven development
```
For Holberton School
Cohort 16.
```
### Background Context

* Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects
* Starting from today:

* Based on the requirements of each task, you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before you actually code anything
* The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline, in order for you to focus more on TDD and think about all possible cases
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case. But not in the implementation of them!
* Don’t trust the user, always think about all possible edge cases
